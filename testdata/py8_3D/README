I used pythia8240 with pythia8-diy:0.6.7 at nersc.

Setup: 2 nodes, i.e. 128 ranks per parameter point,
accumulating 1.28M events per point or 10k events per rank.

Everything is based on Monash 13.

The runcard template is in templates.

Sampling:
    cd templates
    prof2-sample mb.ranges -t mb7tev.cmd -o ../scan -n 1000

The finished runs are in the tarball done.tar.gz.

The corresponding hdf5 representation is in mc.hdf5.
